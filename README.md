# 🧭 GitHub User Activity CLI

A simple **Java command-line tool** that fetches and displays the recent public GitHub activity of any user — like pushes, stars, branch creations, etc.

Built using:
- ☕ Java 17+
- ⚙️ Gradle
- 🌐 `java.net.http.HttpClient`
- 🧩 `org.json` for JSON parsing

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches latest public events from any GitHub user  
- Displays formatted actions such as:
  - Pushed 3 commits to mahtab89/Task-Tracker
  - Created a new branch 'main' in mahtab89/GitHub-User-Activity
  - Starred mahtab89/Task-Tracker
- Handles multiple event types: Push, Create, Watch, Fork, Issues, etc.
- Clean and beginner-friendly Java implementation

---

## 🧠 How It Works
This app makes a GET request to:
```
https://api.github.com/users/<username>/events
```
and parses the returned JSON to show readable activity logs.
